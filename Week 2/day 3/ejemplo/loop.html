//increment by 1
//counter : 1
//counter : 2
//counter : 3


//we need to create a counter (aqui empieza en 1 y termina en 4)

//

let colors= ["blue", "red", "yellow"]
    console.log(colors) // will console log with the coma



//EJEMPLO:

//con loop sale sin coma
let colors= ["blue", "red", "yellow"]
//console.log
//blue
//red
//yellow


// repetive code not good console.log(colors [0], colors [1],colors [2])

//instead we do a for loop

//run three time
for (let counter = 1; counter <= 2; counter++ ){
    //console.log the colors
    console.log(colors[counter])

//because the loop is counting 3 timers i can console log "    console.log(colors[counter])"" 
//without need of doing 3 times beacuse it already have the 3 on the loop

//1st loop : counter = 0 ---> my console.log will be colors [0]
//2nd loop : counter = 1 ---> my console.log will be colors [1]
//3rd loop : counter = 2 ---> my console.log will be colors [2]





//ejemplo infinite "if i dont know the end of the array"


let colors= ["blue", "red", "yellow"]
//console.log
//blue
//red
//yellow 
//like this but million of times.... i just know i want each one by one

//it means i dont know how many iteams are in my array

//somethng more global needs to be done

//end of the array is the length of the array


for (let counter = 0; counter < colors.length; counter++ ){
    //console.log the colors
    console.log(colors[counter])




//ejemplo while

//thers no starting or ending point
//it will ruin forever
//becareful to not create endless loop
//be sure you have a code that make at one time the condition fault
//and will stop the loop

let n=0;
while (n < 3){
    n++;
    console.log(n)
}

//we use only when we
